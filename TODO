jquery-imagebutton TODO

- add error-handling throughout - VERY FRAGILE
- code is entirely untested, so start testing
- write small README
- decide on code license -- for the moment, GPL
- add VIM-isms throughout source file, readme, and TODO, allowing for
  auto-updating edit timestamps
- set up some release preparation tools/scripts (NO AUTOTOOLS)
